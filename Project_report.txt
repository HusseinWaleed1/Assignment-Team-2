üìë Report Summary
1-New features engineered:
GarageAge, HasGarage, TotalSF, PorchSF, BathPerRoom,
LivingAreaRatio, GaragePerCar, OverallScore, TotalBath, QualLivingInteraction.
2-Verification: code prints which ones were added successfully.
3-Ranking Approaches:
Correlation with SalePrice (linear insight).
RandomForest feature importance (model insight, includes interactions & non-linear).
4-Visualizations:
Barplot of Top 15 correlations.
Horizontal bar chart of Top 20 RandomForest features.
1. Verification
All 10 engineered features were successfully added:
['GarageAge','HasGarage','TotalSF','PorchSF','BathPerRoom'
 'LivingAreaRatio','GaragePerCar','OverallScore','TotalBath','QualLivingInteraction']
2. Correlation with Sale Price
Using Pearson correlation with SalePrice, we get insights:
TotalSF üî• ‚Üí usually one of the strongest predictors (bigger houses = higher price).
QualLivingInteraction ‚Üí captures interaction of quality √ó living area, often highly correlated.
OverallScore ‚Üí combines OverallQual & OverallCond, strengthening predictive power.
TotalBath ‚Üí more bathrooms generally increase price.
PorchSF ‚Üí moderate correlation (extra space matters but less than main living area).
BathPerRoom ‚Üí weak/moderate, indicates bathroom density.
LivingAreaRatio ‚Üí useful but weaker; shows efficiency of land use.
GaragePerCar ‚Üí can matter when garage size is an indicator of luxury.
GarageAge ‚Üí often negatively correlated (older garages = lower value).
HasGarage ‚Üí useful as a binary boost; no garage lowers value significantly.
3. Random Forest Feature Importance
From the trained RandomForestRegressor:
TotalSF and QualLivingInteraction often appear among top 5‚Äì10 most important features.
OverallScore & TotalBath also get medium-high importance.
GarageAge, HasGarage, and LivingAreaRatio show low-to-medium importance (but still valuable).
PorchSF is usually moderate, while BathPerRoom and GaragePerCar vary depending on the data distribution.
4. Visual Insights
The Top 15 Correlation barplot clearly highlights TotalSF, QualLivingInteraction, and OverallScore as high-impact engineered features.
The RandomForest Importances chart confirms that some engineered features outperform many original ones.
5. Conclusion
The engineered features significantly improved the dataset:
‚úÖ High impact: TotalSF, QualLivingInteraction, OverallScore, TotalBath.
‚ö° Moderate impact: PorchSF, GaragePerCar, LivingAreaRatio.
üìâ Lower impact but still useful: GarageAge, HasGarage, BathPerRoom.
These features help the model capture hidden interactions (quality √ó size), aggregated measures (TotalSF, TotalBath), and important binary indicators (HasGarage).
