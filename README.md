# 🏠 House Price Prediction Project  

A professional Machine Learning project that predicts house prices based on various features using regression models.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- 📊 Predict house prices using a trained regression model.  
- 🔎 Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand correlations and feature importance.  
- 🛠 Applied **Feature Engineering & Preprocessing** (scaling, splitting, correlation analysis).  
- 📈 Data visualization (heatmaps, descriptive statistics).  
- 🗂 Organized project workflow: Data Cleaning → Preprocessing → Feature Engineering → Model Training → Evaluation.  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **Scikit-learn**  
- **XGBoost / Regression Models**  
- **Pandas & NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**

## 💡 How It Works  
1. Load the dataset.  
2. Perform **data exploration** (shape, info, missing values, duplicates, describe).  
3. Apply **EDA** (correlation, heatmap).  
4. Preprocess data:  
   - Split into features (X) and target (Y).  
   - Train-test split.  
   - Standard scaling.  
5. Train the regression model.  
6. Evaluate model performance using metrics (e.g., R², RMSE).

## 📬 Results & Conclusion  
- The preprocessing and feature engineering improved model accuracy.  
- Strong correlations between certain features and target variable (price) were identified.  
- Final model achieved reliable predictions on test data.
